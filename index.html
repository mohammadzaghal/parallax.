          <h2>Entering the Canopy</h2>
          <p>
            You begin above the clouds, drifting slowly over a floating forest.
            The distant sky barely moves when you scroll, while closer trees and
            islands glide past more quickly. This difference in speed creates
            the feeling of depth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each layer on this page has a different scroll speed. The further
            away it is meant to feel, the smaller its speed. The closer it is,
            the faster it responds to your scrolling.
          </p>

      <section class="section section-middle">
        <div class="section-inner">
          <h2>Between the Islands</h2>
          <p>
            In the middle layer, floating islands and tree silhouettes slide across
            your view. Their motion is controlled with JavaScript using simple
            <code>data-speed</code> attributes. The browser reads that value
            and moves each element at a unique rate.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can extend this idea easily: add more objects, assign a unique
            data-speed to each, and they’ll automatically join the parallax dance.

          <h2>Forest Floor</h2>
          <p>
            Near the bottom, the forest becomes darker and the motion feels slower
            and heavier. You could add buttons, links, or a call-to-action here
            to invite visitors to explore more of your work or your GitHub profile.
          </p>
          <p>
            This entire scene is built with layered backgrounds, absolutely
            positioned objects, and a tiny bit of JavaScript that updates their
            positions based on scroll.
